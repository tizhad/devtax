# Welcome to Transferz Frontend Assignment

In this repository you will find a boilerplate for a client application created with React, Typescript and scss. Use the API provided to fetch a list of journeys and display it on the page. The assignment should take less than 2 hours to complete - don't overcomplicate things and KISS. Feel free to add TODO's to the code.
